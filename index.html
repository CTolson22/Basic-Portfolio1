        <p>Hello, My name is Christa Tolson. I have worked in Retail Sales for four years and I'm looking for a career change.
            So I decided to make to take a risk and switch career paths. So I enrolled into George Washington's Coding Bootcamp.
            I'm hoping this risk pays off in my favor. I currently have two young children that depend on me so I am determined to
            make a comfortable living for them and myself.</p>
